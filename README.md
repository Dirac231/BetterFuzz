## What is this?
BetterFuzz is a collection of functions that i regularly use to fuzz endpoints and files. If you have headaches with filtering, syntaxes, and wordlists, this is for you.

## How to use?
You can simply call the functions against the base URL like this (notice the slash at the end)
```bash
dirfuzz [URL/PATH/]
filefuzz [URL/PATH/]
apifuzz [URL/PATH/]
```
